Monday. I am grateful for the three-day weekend so I could take a real break and get some project planning done. I am not where I want to be right now, so I spent the day reading cool papers and mapping out the major projects I have in the air as well as projected some plans for the remainder of the year. I finished by completing the applicant review for my FHL REU and picking out my top 3-5 candidates. This is exciting!

### February 16

Thursday. Started the day with an awesome BIOL 505 session that helped me think about the power of belonging and active- learning models. I had a meeting with my Assistant Director in HFS to work on a summer plan that either lets me take a leave from my HFS role, or creates a part time position while I'm offsite. I wrapped up the day watching the [Toxicology and Societies](https://cenv.wwu.edu/toxicology-and-societies-speaker-series) talk given by Dr. Markus Hecker

Wednesday. Kicked off the morning with my writing accountability group and was able to knock out some big narrative pieces for the Yellow Island site. Had my BIOL 505 reading meeting and sent a few emails to professors to shadow their classes for my teaching evaluations. I had an awesome check-in with Yaamini where we chatted about the master's proposal process and project planning. Finally, I ended the day on a high note as our Innovation Grant LOI was encouraged to submit a full proposal through EarthLab. Very, very cool.

Tuesday. I started today wrapping up some HFS work that was a carryover from yesterday. After that I met with Ruth Sofield, an aquatic toxicologist at WWU. She is dope! I have some resources, so reading, and a standing monthly meeting to check-in re: my progress. I am excited. The rest of today is delivering the map error coding doc and looking into the resources Ruth shared.

### February 13

Monday. Lab meeting yielded a chance for us all to find out we don't know how to create a map in R. I started compiling my mistakes so everyone can see them and try to help me create one. After that, I had my monthly check-in with Julia. It was a great reminder that I have to put my research work out there while simultaneously working to figure out where I want to fit in. I wrapped up the day going over some logistics for a spring visit to Yellow Island with Matt. I'm lending an extra pair of hands to him over the weekend that will experience a high volume of visitors.

Thurday. This was a day to just put out fires in all of the realms and hope that Friday sees progress since today saw none. I did go to Chuck D's public lecture and it was awesome.

---

### February 8

Wednesday. Started the day with my morning accountability hour, it is turning into a task completion hour more than a writing hour but the tasks are all lab/ science related so I guess that is what we need right now. My next meeting was an informational meeting re: UW graduate programs chat with a a friend from BWEEMS. I had a logistics meeting with Matt for the Yellow Island project, and ended the workday with my Black Grad Student Wellness group.

Friday. Writing accountability group this morning is lovely as always, so happy to have shifted off of Mondays. Following up with FAB acountability group is a great way to take inventory of the week and plan for next week. The rest of the day is dedicated to HFS work.

### February 2

Thursday. BIOL 505 kicked off the day with great discussions about how teachers can and cannot influence class discussion to 'clicker questions', things like Poll Everywhere. The most interesting thing to come out of the reading is the level at which students can teach each other in upper-division courses, it was very cool to see. Even though today, as most Thursdays, was a heavy HFS day I did manage to sneak in a meeting with Andy James to chat all things ecotox. It was awesome, he has a bunch of data sets/ tissue samples that can work into some cool collaborative projects moving forward.

### February 1

Wednesday. Started the morning with my writing accountability session, followed it directly with a Zoom call/ problem solving session with a fellow BWEEMS member. I spent a REU/ DDCSP Program working session with Jose during lunch and then finished with my Black Grad Student wellness group. I reviewed the NSF Propsal for outcomes and expectations for the summer students, put together my February goals posts, and will wrap up by finishing my reading for BIOL 505 tomorrow morning.
