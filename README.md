# Daily Lab Notebook
This is the 'working' lab notebook where daily posts are made to hold me accountable to the practice of daily logging. My full lab notebook can be found HERE. My current projects can be found HERE.
Here's to a productive 2023!

## January 2023

### January 3
Academic work was less rigorous due to the first day back to campus for classes as well as our housing communities. I had a heavy HFS workload but managed to accomplish a few small tasks. Through my HFS colleagues I secured a potential partnership with the DXARTS Maker space to help me flesh out a possible grant writing opportunity. Outside of HFS, today was day one of the SICB 2023 Conference. I signed up for SICB+, the virtual platform and watched tonight's plenary speaker, Dr. Beronda Montgomery. She is a plant scientist, a writer, a mentor, and in the leadership at Grinell College. Most notably for me - she spoke to how we change the environments where we are, how we thrive in community and with collaborations, and how we must start critically interrogating our environments not just (or only) the sole actors who do not conform to it. I also added two papers to my current WDFW mussel lit review that were skimmed and tagged for in-depth reading.

I have been handed my behind by GitHub today. I worked on getting my lab notebook back up and running, get my monthly goals post completed, and just generally spend a bit of time fixing my GH presence. Welp, 3 hours later I believe I have accomplished the bare minimum... Tomorrow is another day. Along with my GitHub trials I did read and annotate the first of three papers for my Thursday BIOL 505 course, Evidence-Based Teaching in Biology: Teaching for Equity in STEM.
