# Daily Lab Notebook
This is the 'working' lab notebook where daily posts are made to hold me accountable to the practice of daily logging. My full lab notebook can be found [HERE](https://chrismantegna.github.io/).
Here's to a productive 2023!

### January 16

Marginal progress was made on the Hall Grant Application, much to my disappointment, but thankfully it is a short one. I seem to have stumped myself connecting all of the ecological relevance dots without sounding hokey. No matter what the outcome, by end of day tomorrow I will have a draft to push to Steven for review. I opened a GH issue to get Sam to help me troubleshoot my desktop RStudio app, it will not let me install or call any of the basic programs. I moved over to Raven to work on my WDFW mussel location map and ran into some issues trying to use the "tmap" package. I'll move over to "ggplot2" and try again tomorrow. It seems I jumped the gun when I went to find Puget Sound shape files, I may not need them afterall. Finally, I worked a bit more on the WDFW mussel site report from 2019/2020 to support priority ranking of the samples we'll process. Another less than stellar find was that looking over the respirometry data for our spring mussel experiment we didn't take any tissue weights. That's a minimal bummer for sure, but it would have been a perk.

Some progress was made today on the map of the WDFW mussel sites, turns out that I had to install Ubuntu and then reinstall R to get the packages to play nice. Tomorrow I will work out the kinks in the code. My other task was to have the base draft for the Hall Grant ready. Its not totally ready, but the introduction and thesis relation protion are complete while the methods, timeine, and budget need a few go arounds with Steven. I lost a bit of time to the PSEMP (Puget Sound Ecosystem Monitoring Program) site and reports. I believe this information can help inform the oder we process our mussel samples.

Saturday is errands/ household tasks day. No lab work today.

### January 13

It has been a week! My sole science accomplishments were attending my accountability meeting with fellow SAFS grad students and scheduling a meeting with Matt for 1/17 to go over respirometry data analysis.

### January 12

No lab related work done today. I had class and a full day of HFS work prepping for my committee commitments and the community fire drills for tomorrow. 

---
### January 11

I submitted the order for calipers to TREQ last night, but that was the only tangible work done that may gave crossed the 12am threshold into today. All of my work today centered around the day job, and given the issues at hand it is likely no lab work will be completed tomorrow either. This is not unexpected, but disappointing as my revised schedule (to accommodate both positions) just went into effect and it feels punitive that today was so full of arbitrary but 'urgent' tasks.

### January 10

Spent more time working on the map of WDFW mussel retrieval locations, very little progress as everytime I load a package in RStudio I get an error when I attempt to call it. Not sure if it's related to my missing Ububtu platform... will test that theory tomorrow. I closed two issues assigned to me over one of the months that end in -ber...small wins. I attended the Gardell Lab meeting virtually and spent some time chatting with Alison, Celeste, and Lindsay (Bonnie Becker Lab UG) and building a lab use schedule. The most promising thing I did today was meet with Tivon Rice, Professor DXARTS to discuss collaboration with me and the lab for the Innovation Grant Proposal. We brainstormed great ideas and potential to bring science and art together to educate. I was able to meet with Rosalind after lab meeting yesterday and she will be participating with her teaching expertise as well. I am cautiously optimistic that this grant application will be strong and competitive based on the strength of these collabs.

Lab meeting today was our standard biweekly DEI meeting. I will have Sam look over my order for digital calipers (for the mussel work) and submit. Other lab focused work was on a bit of map/ locaiton based coding and reading foundational papers about *Mytilus* sp. response to environmental change.

### January 8

Laid back Sunday reading that wrapped up the WDFW/ SAM reports from the mussel monitoring program and read Chapter 10 of the Disordered Cosmos for lab meeting tomorrow.  

---
### January 7

Reading was the name of the game today, specifically the WDFW/ SAM reports of the mussel monitoring partnership program from 2016, 2018, and 2020. The 2016 and 2020 reports are the years before and after the samples we have. Im interested in building a full picture of the scope of the work and how I can add to it as well as build working relationships with some of the partners.

### January 6

I started my morning with a meeting with Miranda Bernard, BIMS grant writer. BIMS will be my community partner for my Innovation Grant Application. next I attended our labs science hour so I can get some advice on the innovation grant, as well as the Hall conservation grant application I'd like to submit. After that, we spend some time learning how to make daily posts & commits to our lab notebooks an easier practice. I am now voice dictating my post for the day. Thanks to Steven's beta test of some new tech. ðŸŽ‰ Exciting!

### January 5

The first meeting of my STEM Teaching Pedegogy course was today and I am excited to develop a teaching statement/ evidence-based philosophy. Other work today focused on fleshing out some grant proposal ideas to bring to the table for my conversations with BIMS and then during Science Hour tomorrow. I believe I have three opportunities to write for interesting grants that could further work in the Yellow Island project and build on work with the WDFW Mussel project.

### January 4

Two main activities today, first was more Lab Notebook work and second was my meeting with Jose. Most of my lab notebook work was taking inventory of where I wanted to tweak my site and what needs to be cleaned up. It is definitely a slow process but at least the site is up and I've been posting regularly. Second, I started my monthly meeting with Jose to rebuild the 'curriculum' for the summer Yellow Island program. I'm working on building something more structured than last summer becasue I'll have REU student(s) as well.

### January 3

Academic work was less rigorous due to the first day back to campus for classes as well as our housing communities. I had a heavy HFS workload but managed to accomplish a few small tasks. Through my HFS colleagues I secured a potential partnership with the DXARTS Maker space to help me flesh out a possible grant writing opportunity. Outside of HFS, today was day one of the SICB 2023 Conference. I signed up for SICB+, the virtual platform and watched tonight's plenary speaker, Dr. Beronda Montgomery. She is a plant scientist, a writer, a mentor, and in the leadership at Grinell College. Most notably for me - she spoke to how we change the environments where we are, how we thrive in community and with collaborations, and how we must start critically interrogating our environments not just (or only) the sole actors who do not conform to it. I also added two papers to my current WDFW mussel lit review that were skimmed and tagged for in-depth reading.

### January 2

I have been handed my behind by GitHub today. I worked on getting my lab notebook back up and running, get my monthly goals post completed, and just generally spend a bit of time fixing my GH presence. Welp, 3 hours later I believe I have accomplished the bare minimum... Tomorrow is another day. Along with my GitHub trials I did read and annotate the first of three papers for my Thursday BIOL 505 course, Evidence-Based Teaching in Biology: Teaching for Equity in STEM.

No work today, it's Sunday for heaven's sake!
