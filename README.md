# Daily Lab Notebook
This is the 'working' lab notebook where daily posts are made to hold me accountable to the practice of daily logging. My full lab notebook can be found [HERE](https://chrismantegna.github.io/).

Wednesday. Started the morning with my writing accountability session, followed it directly with a Zoom call/ problem solving session with a fellow BWEEMS member. I spent a REU/ DDCSP Program working session with Jose during lunch and then finished with my Black Grad Student wellness group. I reviewed the NSF Propsal for outcomes and expectations for the summer students, put together my February goals posts, and will wrap up by finishing my reading for BIOL 505 tomorrow morning.
