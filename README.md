Monday. Attempted Celeste's Tidy Tuesday exercise but didn't get past the data review and base histograms. I didn't have internet at home until this afternoon, so getting anything done after the move was a bit too diffiult. I did attend teh second part of a 3 part eDNA webinar series. Tonight's content was about how to interpret results and verify your survey design & assay validations.

Monday. Lab meeting with DEI focus on Chapter 2 of Invisible Women, we had a really interesting conversation about the impact of oversight in small decisions. Spring Break starts today, so I am focusing on moving, the HFS job, and getting my Spring Quarter Schedule set. I spent the evening in part 1 of a 3 part series on eDNA technologies and uses lead by EnviroDNA, an Australian company.

Thurday. BIOL 505 was the only realted task. HFS work dominated today.

### March 8

Wednesday. Watched the White House Forum on Campus & Community Scale Climate Change Solutions, Dean Tolstoy gave the closing remarks. It was interesting to see the lack of diversity in the panels as well as in the solutions. I don't believe the correct amount of time was allocated to a true conversation about this.

Friday. Writing hour was the only thing that went to plan today. The rest of my day was putting out fires for the day job and facilitating the BIPOC Affinity Space to debrief from the DEI session the day before.

### March 2

Thursday. The BIOL 505 Panel was outstanding. Representatives from R1s, Community College, Industry/ start-ups, and research on pedagogy in WA state all spoke to us about what it means to be an effective educator. Followed that with a successful DEI session in the weekly RLT meeting, I was encouraged to see the level of participation in a program my colleagues and I have worked hard to put together. After lunch with my labmates I held the first Innovation Grant planning meeting, it was a whirlwind 30 minutes but super productive. We set milestones for the upcoming application pieces and now it's time to knock it out. I ended the day observing Ken Sebens Invertebrate Zoology and attending to an HFS issue.

### March 1

Wednesday. Kicked off with writing hour, followed up with panel question generation with my BIOL 505 partner, completed two of the assigned EH&S trainings required to do work in the Gardell Lab, moved into HFS work, attended the seminar for the second of four Coastal Ecologist positions, and wrapped up the day trying to make my lab notebook cool.
