### January 30

Monday morning writing accountability group to kick off the week, followed by lab meeting and picking up my new digital calipers. Most of today was devoted to HFS work, but I did manage to put together a tentative schedule of collaborators for the DDCSP folks. I am excited! We have Tiara locked in, a 3 phase wellness series, and a week of data analysis stuff coming together. I am happy to see some things coming together with the best possible timeline to make it engaging and low lift for folks giving their time and expertise. Stoked!

### January 29

Light work today. I completed the reading for BIOL 505 and did a bit of work framing out the program for FHL/ DDCSP this summer. 

---
### January 28

Saturdays are for errands and some work on the Yellow Island webpage. Really only put together the categories of participants and the Spotify Playlist to add.

---
### January 27

It is a hard one today as I work to still process the hate crimes and gun violence of the year knowing that brutal police footage will be released tonight. I am making it a point to avoid social media so I don't witness the body camera footage, but the anxiety of holding the situation and avoiding the evidence is making it difficult to focus. Much of today has been spent on small tasks. The FAB weekly check-in was lovely and helpful when thinking about the milestones in the degree process.

### January 26

Today is the day for the Innovation Grant Letter of Intention submission. Everyone has had a chance to review the edits and application, both letters of support are in, and submission is in! It feels good to get this into the hands of the folks who make the decisions. The rest of today has been split three ways between (1) BIOL 505 work on my core ideals for the classroom, (2) outlining some teaching content for the summer REU, and (3) HFS student leader application evaluation. 

---
### January 25

The vast majority of work is HFS centric. We are in the review process for student leader applications for Spring training and Fall start. The positive problem of having a few hundred application is the time it takes to review them! I knocked out the Core Ideas assignment and finalized the updates to the Innovation Grant LOI, and even managed to get in some reading for the intertidal program.

### January 24

Tuesdays are remote days where I can be found in the lab office vice my HFS office. The morning was meeting heavy, one of which was with the Sea Potential crew. It was great to have both the founders, Savannah and Ebony, as well as my former DDCSP mentee together future planning with me! I'm so glad to have them on board with the Innovation Grant. Moving through the day I worked on summer program content and a list of requests from the creative team at BIMS for the summer program. Afternoon writing accountability with the FAB crew was awesome - always grateful to spend time with SAFS grad students that are more advanced in their path than I am.

### January 23

Started the day with a co-writing session with a friend from Cornell, we will be writing Monday and Wednesday mornings for the next quarter. Led lab meeting DEI session this morning, we had a great discussion about place and knowing as valuable knowledge sets that can work with existing scientific knowledge instead of the current antagonistic framing. Spent some time working on my BIOL 505 Core Concepts deliverable, finding resources in professional organization pages is more difficult than I anticipated.

---
### January 22

Spent today reviewing both the Innovation Grant and the Hall Grant proposals. I was able to secure Sea Potential as a second community partner for the Innovation Grant and set a meeting with them for Tuesday morning to go over their contribution ideas to the grant. I wrapped up the grant edits and prepared to submit the Hall. I started reading through the first two papers for my teaching course and went to work on some writing/ lesson planning for my summer program. After a quick check-in with Steven I submitted the Hall and wrapped up the day planning for the week.

---
### January 21

At the wee hours of the morning I got the Hall draft over to Steven. I checked in around lunchtime to see only minor edits and kept going about my Satuday errands and household tasks. 

---
### January 20

Started the day with my FAB accountability group, continued onto the lab-wide lunch with the prosepective grad students, followed that up with an informal metoring moment with a freshman marine biology student, and wrapped up working hours in the lab office working with Zach to come up with a module for my summer program. We're trying to work in some remote sensing/ drone mapping/ GIS stuff. This will be awesome! I wrapped up the day by getting the Hall draft finished and to Steven at a ridiculous hour that technically qualifies for 1/21/23.

---
### January 19

Spent the day in the lab office after wrapping up some HFS tasks. Spent lunch with Zach, Olivia, and Matt (at the end). Went on to meet with Marco Hatch for a 30 minute 1v1. We spent time talking about what he's reading, how to integrate identity into work without burning out, and what the future of shellfish fisheries may look like. Following that, Zach and I were able to meet with prospective Roberts Lab students to chat informally and answer any of their questions, I believe a few of them would make a great match for the lab. I wrapped up the day by attending the Bevans Seminar with Marco Hatch as the speaker, it was interesting and thought provoking - especially when thinking about the 'boundary spanners' in our lives and work.

---
### January 18

Finally wrapped up the Innovation grant draft. Finished my readings for BIOL 505, and put down the deposit for my next diving trip. I was able to get back in touch with Andy James and set a meeting to discuss a data set that may be interesting to me. Steven will be away, but Alison may be available to join. Definitely cool.

### January 17

Started the morning with a BIMS meeting. Awesome to start your day finding out your program is being funded, your expenses are being covered, and you've got a letter of support coming your way. Can't beat a meeting with Tiara! Follwed it up with a timely lesson in pedagogy and lesson planning with Rosalind - easy way to get hyped up about teaching some intertidal ecology content. Along the way I had to work because I was the COVID Iso/ Quarantine point person for Res Life today. Continuing on the productivity meeting train I met with my Accountability Group (FAB) to write for just over an hour - I was not as productive here as I could be. I'm finding it difficult to focus on writing later in the day and I have to get out of that. From there I wrapped up my HFS work day and went back to some lab tasks after dinner. End of day task was to complete the ranking of contaminant profiles of the WDFW sampled sites. After putting all of the 2018 and 2020 data together it is still difficult to make a good ranking system, so layering in location will help.

### January 16

Marginal progress was made on the Hall Grant Application, much to my disappointment, but thankfully it is a short one. I seem to have stumped myself connecting all of the ecological relevance dots without sounding hokey. No matter what the outcome, by end of day tomorrow I will have a draft to push to Steven for review. I opened a GH issue to get Sam to help me troubleshoot my desktop RStudio app, it still will not let me install or call any of the basic programs. I moved over to Raven to work on my WDFW mussel location map and ran into some issues trying to use the "tmap" package. I'll move over to using the "ggplot2" package and try again tomorrow. It seems I jumped the gun when I went to find Puget Sound shape files, I may not need them afterall. Finally, I worked a bit more on the WDFW mussel site report from 2019/2020 to support priority ranking of the samples we'll process. Another less than stellar find was that looking over the respirometry data for our spring mussel experiment we didn't take any tissue weights. That's a minimal bummer for sure, but it would have been a perk.

---
### January 15

Some progress was made today on the map of the WDFW mussel sites, turns out that I had to install Ubuntu and then reinstall R to get the packages to play nice, but there are still some pakcages that just won't load. Tomorrow I will work out the kinks in the code. My other task was to have the base draft for the Hall Grant ready. Its not totally ready, but the introduction and thesis relation protion are complete while the methods, timeine, and budget need a few go arounds with Steven. I lost a bit of time to the PSEMP (Puget Sound Ecosystem Monitoring Program) site and reports. I believe this information can help inform the order we process our mussel samples.

### January 14

Saturday is errands/ household tasks day. No lab work today. 

---
### January 13

It has been a week! My sole science accomplishments were attending my accountability meeting with fellow SAFS grad students and scheduling a meeting with Matt for 1/17 to go over respirometry data analysis.

---
### January 12

No lab related work done today. I had class and a full day of HFS work prepping for my committee commitments and the community fire drills for tomorrow. 

---
### January 11

I submitted the order for calipers to TREQ last night, but that was the only tangible work done that may have crossed the 12am threshold into today. All of my work today centered around the day job, and given the issues at hand it is likely no lab work will be completed tomorrow either. This is not unexpected, but disappointing as my revised schedule (to accommodate both positions) just went into effect and it feels punitive that today was so full of arbitrary but 'urgent' tasks. 

---
### January 10

Spent more time working on the map of WDFW mussel retrieval locations, very little progress as everytime I load a package in RStudio I get an error when I attempt to call it. Not sure if it's related to my missing Ubuntu platform... will test that theory tomorrow. I closed two issues assigned to me over one of the months that end in -ber...small wins. I attended the Gardell Lab meeting virtually and spent some time chatting with Alison, Celeste, and Lindsay (Bonnie Becker Lab UG) and building a lab use schedule. The most promising thing I did today was meet with Tivon Rice, Professor DXARTS to discuss collaboration with me and the lab for the Innovation Grant Proposal. We brainstormed great ideas and potential to bring science and art together to educate. I was able to meet with Rosalind after the Roberts lab meeting yesterday and she will be participating with her teaching expertise as well. I am cautiously optimistic that this grant application will be strong and competitive based on the strength of these collabs.

### January 9

Lab meeting today was our standard biweekly DEI meeting. I will have Sam look over my order for digital calipers (for the mussel work) and submit. Other lab focused work was on a bit of map/ location based coding and reading foundational papers about *Mytilus* sp. response to environmental change. 

---
### January 8

Laid back Sunday reading that wrapped up the WDFW/ SAM reports from the mussel monitoring program and read Chapter 10 of the Disordered Cosmos for lab meeting tomorrow.  

---
### January 7

Reading was the name of the game today, specifically the WDFW/ SAM reports of the mussel monitoring partnership program from 2016, 2018, and 2020. The 2016 and 2020 reports are the years before and after the samples we have. Im interested in building a full picture of the scope of the work and how I can add to it as well as build working relationships with some of the partners. 

---
### January 6

I started my morning with a meeting with Miranda Bernard, BIMS grant writer. BIMS will be my community partner for my Innovation Grant Application. Next I attended our labs science hour so I can get some advice on the innovation grant, as well as the Hall conservation grant application I'd like to submit. After that, we spend some time learning how to make daily posts & commits to our lab notebooks an easier practice. I am now voice dictating my post for the day. Thanks to Steven's beta test of some new tech. 🎉 Exciting!

---
### January 5

The first meeting of my STEM Teaching Pedegogy course was today and I am excited to develop a teaching statement/ evidence-based philosophy. Other work today focused on fleshing out some grant proposal ideas to bring to the table for my conversations with BIMS and then during Science Hour tomorrow. I believe I have three opportunities to write for interesting grants that could further work in the Yellow Island project and build on work with the WDFW Mussel project.

---
### January 4

Two main activities today, first was more Lab Notebook work and second was my meeting with Jose. Most of my lab notebook work was taking inventory of where I wanted to tweak my site and what needs to be cleaned up. It is definitely a slow process but at least the site is up and I've been posting regularly. Second, I started my monthly meeting with Jose to rebuild the 'curriculum' for the summer Yellow Island program. I'm working on building something more structured than last summer becasue I'll have REU student(s) as well.

### January 3

Academic work was less rigorous due to the first day back to campus for classes as well as our housing communities. I had a heavy HFS workload but managed to accomplish a few small tasks. Through my HFS colleagues I secured a potential partnership with the DXARTS Maker space to help me flesh out a possible grant writing opportunity. Outside of HFS, today was day one of the SICB 2023 Conference. I signed up for SICB+, the virtual platform and watched tonight's plenary speaker, Dr. Beronda Montgomery. She is a plant scientist, a writer, a mentor, and in the leadership at Grinell College. Most notably for me - she spoke to how we change the environments where we are, how we thrive in community and with collaborations, and how we must start critically interrogating our environments not just (or only) the sole actors who do not conform to it. I also added two papers to my current WDFW mussel lit review that were skimmed and tagged for in-depth reading.

---
### January 2

I have been handed my behind by GitHub today. I worked on getting my lab notebook back up and running, get my monthly goals post completed, and just generally spend a bit of time fixing my GH presence. Welp, 3 hours later I believe I have accomplished the bare minimum... Tomorrow is another day. Along with my GitHub trials I did read and annotate the first of three papers for my Thursday BIOL 505 course, Evidence-Based Teaching in Biology: Teaching for Equity in STEM.

### January 1

No work today, it's Sunday for heaven's sake!
