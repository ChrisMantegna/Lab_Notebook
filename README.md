Tuesday. I started today wrapping up some HFS work that was a carryover from yesterday. After that I met with Ruth Sofield, an aquatic toxicologist at WWU. She is dope! I have some resources, so reading, and a standing monthly meeting to check-in re: my progress. I am excited. The rest of today is delivering the map error coding doc and looking into the resources Ruth shared.

Monday. Lab meeting yielded a chance for us all to find out we don't know how to create a map in R. I started compiling my mistakes so everyone can see them and try to help me create one. After that, I had my monthly check-in with Julia. It was a great reminder that I have to put my research work out there while simultaneously working to figure out where I want to fit in. I wrapped up the day going over some logistics for a spring visit to Yellow Island with Matt. I'm lending an extra pair of hands to him over the weekend that will experience a high volume of visitors.

Sunday. I did some ecotox reading, trying to figure a scope or direction for my whole grad path. Definitely feeling internal pressure to knock out some milestones. Completed the Tidy Tuesday exercise for lab meeting on Monday.

Thurday. This was a day to just put out fires in all of the realms and hope that Friday sees progress since today saw none. I did go to Chuck D's public lecture and it was awesome.

Wednesday. Started the day with my morning accountability hour, it is turning into a task completion hour more than a writing hour but the tasks are all lab/ science related so I guess that is what we need right now. My next meeting was an informational meeting re: UW graduate programs chat with a a friend from BWEEMS. I had a logistics meeting with Matt for the Yellow Island project, and ended the workday with my Black Grad Student Wellness group.

Friday. Writing accountability group this morning is lovely as always, so happy to have shifted off of Mondays. Following up with FAB acountability group is a great way to take inventory of the week and plan for next week. The rest of the day is dedicated to HFS work.

Thursday. BIOL 505 kicked off the day with great discussions about how teachers can and cannot influence class discussion to 'clicker questions', things like Poll Everywhere. The most interesting thing to come out of the reading is the level at which students can teach each other in upper-division courses, it was very cool to see. Even though today, as most Thursdays, was a heavy HFS day I did manage to sneak in a meeting with Andy James to chat all things ecotox. It was awesome, he has a bunch of data sets/ tissue samples that can work into some cool collaborative projects moving forward.

Wednesday. Started the morning with my writing accountability session, followed it directly with a Zoom call/ problem solving session with a fellow BWEEMS member. I spent a REU/ DDCSP Program working session with Jose during lunch and then finished with my Black Grad Student wellness group. I reviewed the NSF Propsal for outcomes and expectations for the summer students, put together my February goals posts, and will wrap up by finishing my reading for BIOL 505 tomorrow morning.
