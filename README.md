Tuesday. Heavy content and self-paced learning day. We spent the morning learning how to use R, RStudio, GitHub, Zotero, and our Google Drive for course content. I need to go back and add content for downloading GH desktop, how to use a reference manager, and how to build from base R. The afternoon was focused on their projects, progress, and next steps for the week.

Monday. We spent the day on Yellow Island. We completed species inventories in sections 3-5 and the jetty between sections 4 and 5; this is the first time we've been able to complete the inventory on the jetty. After that we participated in the Juneteenth celebration on the island where we were able to show visitors what we knew about the intertidal and help them poke around and see cool things. Sarah supported our learning of seaweeds by helping with ID and facts about each one that we were able to find. We wrapped the day debriefiing the activities and talking about what we were grateful for.

Saturday. I took some REU students to tour the Hodin Lab where they are breeding pycnopodia to support their repopulation in Salish. Did some work on the DDCSP & REU content for next week. I scheduled 5 of the 6 Guest Scientist spots and put together the platforms and sites we'll use for the duration of the program. Personally I researched the Margaret A Davisdson Fellowship throug NOAA and the NSF GEOHealth INTERN open call for potential applications. Finally, I started a Teaching 101 course where we learn Hybrid classroom skills.
