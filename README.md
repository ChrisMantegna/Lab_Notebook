# Daily Lab Notebook
This is the 'working' lab notebook where daily posts are made to hold me accountable to the practice of daily logging. My full lab notebook can be found HERE. My current projects can be found HERE.
Here's to a productive 2023!

### January 2

I have been handed my behind by GitHub today. I worked on getting my lab notebook back up and running, get my monthly goals post completed, and just generally spend a bit of time fixing my GH presence. Welp, 3 hours later I believe I have accomplished the bare minimum... Tomorrow is another day. Along with my GitHub trials I did read and annotate the first of three papers for my Thursday BIOL 505 course, Evidence-Based Teaching in Biology: Teaching for Equity in STEM.
