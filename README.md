Saturday. I took some REU students to tour the Hodin Lab where they are breeding pycnopodia to support their repopulation in Salish. Did some work on the DDCSP & REU content for next week. I scheduled 5 of the 6 Guest Scientist spots and put together the platforms and sites we'll use for the duration of the program. Personally I researched the Margaret A Davisdson Fellowship throug NOAA and the NSF GEOHealth INTERN open call for potential applications. Finally, I started a Teaching 101 course where we learn Hybrid classroom skills.
