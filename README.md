Thurday. This was a day to just put out fires in all of the realms and hope that Friday sees progress since today saw none.

Wednesday. Started the day with my morning accountability hour, it is turning into a task completion hour more than a writing hour but the tasks are all lab/ science related so I guess that is what we need right now. My next meeting was an informational meeting re: UW graduate programs chat with a a friend from BWEEMS. I had a logistics meeting with Matt for the Yellow Island project, and ended the workday with my Black Grad Student Wellness group.

Friday. Writing accountability group this morning is lovely as always, so happy to have shifted off of Mondays. Following up with FAB acountability group is a great way to take inventory of the week and plan for next week. The rest of the day is dedicated to HFS work.

Thursday. BIOL 505 kicked off the day with great discussions about how teachers can and cannot influence class discussion to 'clicker questions', things like Poll Everywhere. The most interesting thing to come out of the reading is the level at which students can teach each other in upper-division courses, it was very cool to see. Even though today, as most Thursdays, was a heavy HFS day I did manage to sneak in a meeting with Andy James to chat all things ecotox. It was awesome, he has a bunch of data sets/ tissue samples that can work into some cool collaborative projects moving forward.

Wednesday. Started the morning with my writing accountability session, followed it directly with a Zoom call/ problem solving session with a fellow BWEEMS member. I spent a REU/ DDCSP Program working session with Jose during lunch and then finished with my Black Grad Student wellness group. I reviewed the NSF Propsal for outcomes and expectations for the summer students, put together my February goals posts, and will wrap up by finishing my reading for BIOL 505 tomorrow morning.
