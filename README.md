Wednesday. Kicked off with writing hour, followed up with panel question generation with my BIOL 505 partner, completed two of the assigned EH&S trainings required to do work in the Gardell Lab, moved into HFS work, attended the seminar for the second of four Coastal Ecologist positions, and wrapped up the day trying to make my lab notebook cool.
